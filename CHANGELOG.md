## Brox Kai v2.0 — Premium Agent Conversation Experience

### Added
- Added a turn-scoped Agent Activity disclosure for observable tool, MCP, terminal, and file-operation activity.
- Correlated concurrent tool execution and completion by stable tool-call IDs, with legacy name matching only when IDs are absent.
- Added expandable, bounded activity details with secret-pattern redaction and explicit lifecycle status.
- Kept tool approval cards as separate permission gates; collapsing activity never changes runtime execution.
- Removed provider reasoning payloads from visible conversation messages; the timeline presents observable execution rather than private model deliberation.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for concurrent same-name tool calls, out-of-order completion, failed tool results, and shell command mapping.

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — 2027 Premium AI Agent UI Migration refinements

### Changed
- Added a compact Agent HUD layout for narrow chat workspaces; secondary actions move into an overflow menu while provider/model selection remains reachable.
- Standardized primary chat controls, provider/model picker rows, and assistant message actions on 48dp minimum touch targets.
- Replaced hardcoded Premium Dark welcome-state colors and settings status colors with shared semantic design tokens.
- Reduced-motion mode now renders static agent orbs without starting infinite pulse animations.

### Tests
- Added a compact HUD breakpoint regression test at 720dp.
- Retained existing premium-dark home, conversation, settings, and sandbox screenshot fixtures.

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — One Chat Interface (Interactive UI Merged)

### Added
- The chat header now carries an **interactive UI toggle** (a widgets icon, tinted while the mode is on), and the sidebar's "Interactive UI" entry doubles as the same toggle with its state shown
- The back action (remove the last exchange) sits next to the toggle and appears only while interactive mode is on

### Changed
- Interactive UI is no longer a separate full-screen interface — it is a mode of the one chat. The kai-ui screens render inline in the conversation, so the timeline, the composer and the rest of the chat stay available
- Switching the mode no longer starts a new chat or clears the conversation; it changes how the next answer is produced and rendered
- While interactive mode is on, the service picker only lists agentic-capable services and models (as the old interactive screen did)
- The interactive system prompt now tells the model that its screen renders inside the chat and that text outside the kai-ui fence is shown as ordinary chat text
- A conversation's type follows the mode, so a chat reopens in the mode it was left in

### Removed
- The separate Interactive UI screen with its own top bar, welcome screen, collapsed input pill and full-screen kai-ui renderer

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Chat Works Out of the Box (Kilo Gateway + OpenCode)

### Added
- New **Kilo Gateway** provider (`https://api.kilo.ai/api/gateway`) — one OpenAI-compatible endpoint for every provider, with a free tier that needs no API key (`kilo-auto/free` rotates through the free models)
- A bare install now starts with two keyless providers configured — **Kilo Gateway** and **OpenCode** — with their free models pre-selected, so the first message works without adding any service or provider
- The built-in Free tier (Free FAST / Free EXPERT) stays the last-resort fallback behind them

### Changed
- The default provider seeding runs once per install: an install that already has services keeps exactly what it has, and a default provider the user deletes stays deleted (it can be re-added from Settings → Services)

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Midnight Theme + Theme Switch Buttons

### Added
- New **Midnight** theme: a deep-navy dark variant (background `#06152E`, surfaces `#0E2A4D`) that keeps the cyan brand accent without going pitch black — sitting between the neutral Dark theme and the pure-black OLED one
- The theme picker is now a row of **switch buttons** (System · Light · Dark · OLED · Midnight) instead of a dropdown, so every theme is visible at a glance and switching takes a single tap

### Changed
- `ThemeMode` gains `Midnight`; the stored preference keeps working, and Android system bars use light icons for it like the other dark themes

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Model Picker in the Chat

### Added
- The chat header shows the model that is loaded: the pill carries the provider icon, the active service and the model it is running
- Tapping the pill opens the models the active service can run (the loaded one highlighted) above the service list, so the AI model can be switched at any time without leaving the chat
- The provider's model list is fetched when the picker opens rather than on every chat start; if the fetch fails, the curated defaults stay selectable
- Picking a model stores it for that service instance — the next message uses it and the choice survives a restart

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Settings Split Into Category Tabs

### Added
- Settings is split per feature category again: the features that were stacked inside the General tab now have their own tab each — **Agent** (soul, memories, scheduled tasks, heartbeat, email, SMS, notifications), **Tools** (native tools, MCP servers, skills), **Integrations** (Splinterlands, integration requests) and **Sandbox** (Linux sandbox)
- The Sandbox tab appears only where the sandbox exists (Android); other platforms no longer show a tab that would open on an empty page
- The Tools tab's "install the sandbox first" prompt now opens the Sandbox tab directly

### Changed
- `SettingsTab` enum: `General, Model, Data, Account` → `General, Agent, Services, Tools, Integrations, Sandbox, Data, Account` (the former `Model` tab is now `Services`, matching its "Model & API Key" content and the already-translated tab strings)
- General keeps the app-level preferences only: overview, theme, UI scale, dynamic UI, daemon mode, export/import
- Dashboard deep links follow the new tabs: "Set up a service" opens Services, "Tools" opens Tools

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Desktop Auto-Updater (GitHub Release Check)

### Added
- Desktop auto-update check: on startup the desktop app queries GitHub Releases (`habibbrox2/brox-kai-2.0`, throttled to one check per 4 hours) and shows an "Update Available" dialog with release notes and a Download & Install button when the latest `v2.0.*` release is newer than the running version
- New common updater module (`composeApp/src/*/kotlin/com/inspiredandroid/kai/updater/`): all release-checking logic is platform-independent; platform differences are isolated behind two expect/actual functions — `httpGet` (desktop/android use `java.net.HttpURLConnection`, wasmJs/iOS use ktor) and `currentPlatformKey` (JVM derives Windows / macOS x64+arm64 / Linux from `os.name`+`os.arch`; web and iOS report `none`)
- Release-asset picker keys on the platform key: `.msi` for Windows, `.dmg` (aarch64-aware) for macOS, `.deb`/`.AppImage`/`.tar.gz` (aarch64-aware) for Linux

### Fixed
- The earlier commonMain interface + platform `actual object` split did not compile (redeclaration + supertype loop); replaced with a single common `AutoUpdater` object and federated expect/actual function implementations

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 - Premium Chat UI + Code Editor (Plan 7)

### Added
- Chat-first launch: Android and every other platform now open directly into the Chat UI; the Dashboard lives as a sidebar link (brand click)
- New AppSidebar: New Chat button + live search, time-grouped conversation list (Pinned / Today / Yesterday / Previous 7 Days / Previous 30 Days / Older), rename / pin / delete via per-row menu, bottom destinations (Dashboard, Interactive UI, Kai Build on Android, Settings) plus the Brox Kai 2.0 brand
- ModalNavigationDrawer sidebar on compact windows + permanent 280dp rail on expanded windows
- Redesigned TopBar: drawer toggle, centered model-selector pill, right-side quick actions (sandbox, speech output, settings)
- Redesigned EmptyState: small animated mark, "How can I help you today?" heading, 2x2 quick-start cards with title + subtext and hover glow
- Response action bar under every assistant message: Copy, Thumbs Up/Down (local-only), Regenerate, Read Aloud
- CodeFenceBlock header: language tag + "Copy code" button + "Open in editor" hook
- New CodeEditorScreen: monospace editable editor opened from any chat code block
- Settings restructured to 4 tabs: General, Model and API Key, Data Control, Account and Plan
- Error handling moved from centered ErrorMessage blocks to a top-right toast badge with retry
- Time-based chat history grouping, rename, pin, delete and live title search

### Changed
- SettingsTab enum reduced from 6 to 4 (General, Model, Data, Account)
- Conversation gains isPinned / pinnedAt (defaulted, backward compatible)
- App start destination changed from Dashboard to Home (Chat)

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Auto-Release Pipeline (Auto Version Bump + GitHub Release)

### Added
- `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`: on every push to `main`, automatically bumps the Brox Kai 2.0 version (patch +1 over the latest `v2.0.*` tag), updates `appVersion`/`versionCode` in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, commits and tags `v2.0.x`, builds the Foss APK + Windows x64 MSI + Windows x64 zip from that tag, and publishes a GitHub Release named `Brox Kai 2.0 v2.0.x` — "Brox Kai 2.0" is the fixed brand name, only the version changes; assets are named `Brox-Kai-2.0-v2.0.x-<platform>.<ext>`
- `.github/workflows/apk.yml`: on-demand Foss APK build (`workflow_dispatch`) usable from the Actions tab without tag pushes or signing secrets

### Changed
- Base `appVersion` in the version catalog realigned from upstream `3.3.0` to the Brox Kai `2.0.3` line; each auto-release increments it going forward

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Desktop Shell: `sleep` Allowed + Cancellation Test Fix

### Added
- Desktop `ShellCommandTool` allowlist now includes `sleep` — side-effect-free wait primitive, bounded by the existing per-call timeout (Android shell is unaffected: it runs inside the proot sandbox)

### Fixed
- `ShellCommandToolTest > cancelling a running command kills it` failed on CI: the P0-B test rewrite used `sleep 3`, which the fail-closed allowlist rejects, so the command never started and nothing was ever cancelled (the test body skips on Windows, so it only surfaced on the Linux runner)
- Cancellation test now runs `sleep 27.314` (odd duration, collision-proof) and verifies via `ProcessHandle` that the process is actually killed after cancellation, replacing the vestigial marker-file check that nothing ever created

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Home Dashboard UI Upgrade (Plan 6)

### Added
- Dashboard launch route (`Dashboard`) with 3-tab navigation (Dashboard/Chat/Settings) and typed `Settings(tab)` / `Build(project)` destinations
- `ui/dashboard/` — `DashboardModels.kt` (read-only aggregation + `buildDashboardUiState`, `DESIGN_STARTER_PROMPT`) and `DashboardScreen.kt` (header, readiness, responsive primary action grid 1/2/4 columns, recent conversations/projects with resume + View all)
- Dashboard cards: Chat (primary), Kai Build (Android-only, honest disabled note), Design (opens chat with guided design prefill), Tools (Settings/Tools)
- `ChatViewModel.startDesignChat` + `loadConversation` made public for dashboard resume; `TopBar` gets mobile Home button; `SettingsScreen`/`KaiBuildScreen` accept initial tab/project

### Changed
- App start destination moved to Dashboard; Chat/Settings navigation anchors to Dashboard
- `Home` route preserved as chat workspace (reachable from Dashboard/Chat tab)

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 - Services & Sponsors UI Upgrade (Plan 5)

### Added

- Compact Services overview card: configured-service count with attention/checking/connected status badge; empty state when nothing is configured.
- Grouped add-service sheet (Hosted providers / On-device / Custom endpoints) with a setup-requirement summary on every provider row.
- `SupportProfile` model + mapper: Brox Kai owner profile first (stable id, repository identity, local branded avatar), then current and past sponsors with the previous deduplication.
- `SupportSection` with `OwnerProfileCard`, `SponsorGrid`, and width-tiered collapse (2/4/6 tiles at 600/900dp) plus a `Show all sponsors` / `Collapse sponsors` toggle that announces the hidden count.
- `SupportLinks` configuration block owning every support-area URL.
- Drag handle now meets the 48dp touch-target minimum around its 24dp glyph.

### Changed

- Service card headers: color-only connection dot replaced with a text status badge covering every connection state; expand/reorder behavior unchanged.
- Sponsor area rebuilt: owner card always first (never hidden by the collapsed limit), grid above the sponsorship/partnership CTAs, animated expand/collapse that preserves toggle focus, no redundant toggle for short lists, link cards carry accessible names and stay informational without a destination.

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Tools & Sandbox Workspace UI Upgrade (Plan 4)

### Added

- Shared operational components (`ui/components/OperationalComponents.kt`): status vocabulary, status color ramp, `StatusBadge` (text + color), `CapabilityCountCard`, `CollectionEmptyState`.
- Tools Overview header summarizing enabled native tools, connected MCP servers, and installed skills with attention/needs-setup badges (responsive 3/2/1 columns).
- Native tools search/filter when 8+ tools are present, with localized-name matching and a no-match empty state.
- Sandbox setup readiness flow: distribution from state, Needs setup / Installing / Failed badge, storage + session expectations, and a "Retry setup" action after failure.
- Common sandbox workspace header (semantic heading + Ready badge) shared by Terminal, Files, and Packages.
- Explicit confirmation before skill uninstall (previously a single tap removed the skill).

### Changed

- MCP server cards: raw status dot replaced with a text status badge including `Disabled` and `Not checked` states; dedicated empty state for the server list.
- Sandbox subtab selector: only the selected tab is primary + semibold (previously all three tabs were primary, hiding the active tab); `Role.Tab`/selected semantics on tabs and session chips.
- Session chips get a larger touch target; skills and native tools use dedicated empty-state cards instead of plain text.

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Kai Build Workspace UI Upgrade (Plan 3)

### Added

- `BuildDesignTokens`: Build-specific spacing, shapes, status kinds/colors, terminal surfaces, environment/step status mapping.
- Reusable `BuildStatusPill` and `BuildProgressBlock` components for session tabs, headers, and setup progress.
- Project hub environment readiness header with next-action guidance and semantic section headings.
- Dedicated Agent Manager card, split from the system info card.
- Step-based setup surface (Choose agents → Install → Verify) derived from `KaiBuildUiState`, with an actionable Retry on failure.
- File-scoped Find/Replace panel with live match count and Replace-all confirmation (flows through the existing save/dirty model).
- Centralized `buildWorkspaceTier(width)` policy: hub content centers on expanded windows, full-bleed on compact/medium.

### Changed

- Session bar is project-aware: names the active project and shows a Running/Idle status pill next to the session title.
- Session tabs expose `Role.Tab`, selection state, and announce running/idle to screen readers.
- Project title capped at 180 dp so narrow windows keep the session strip usable.
- Setup title/description folded into the environment header and step guide.

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Settings UI Upgrade (Plan 2)

### Added

- `SettingsDesignTokens` and `SettingsSectionHeader` with semantic heading semantics.
- `SettingsNavigation` rail + `SettingsDetailPane` extraction; rail + detail pane on expanded (≥840dp), horizontal selector on compact.
- Overview card atop General tab: `SettingsStatusRow`, `SettingsKeyValueRow`, `SettingsOverview` (sandbox install status).
- `SettingsConfirmDialog` (destructive confirmations) and `SettingsStatusBanner` (Info/Progress/Warning/Error) for skills and MCP errors.

### Changed

- `SettingsScreenContent` restructured with `BoxWithConstraints`; `BottomInfo` made internal.
- MCP server removal now confirms first; skill install/browse failures surface as banners instead of bare text.
- Delete-downloaded-model icon button gained a content description.

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Chat UI Upgrade (Phase 1 & 2) + Follow-up Suggestions

### Added
- **Phase 1 — Foundations**: `ChatDesignTokens.kt` (spacing, shapes, surface/status colors), plus reusable `StatusPill`, `PanelHeading`, `ChatActionButton` components.
- **Phase 2 — Responsive shell**: `ChatAdaptivePolicy` (compact/medium/expanded), `ChatShell` (adaptive rail/main/side-panel/overlays), `ChatTimeline`, `ChatComposer`, `ConversationRail` extractions; conversation column centered at 760dp.
- **Follow-up suggestions**: after a successful (non-interactive) reply, the app generates 3 short follow-up questions via a silent LLM call and shows them as chips below the last assistant message; tapping a chip sends it. State is cleared on new chat / conversation load / error.

### Changed
- `ChatScreen.kt` — `ChatModeScreen` now composes through `ChatShell` (header/rail/main/overlays) instead of a monolithic Box/Column.
- `ChatViewModel.kt` — follow-up generation + clearing wired into ask/clearHistory/startNewChat/loadConversation.
- `ChatUiState.kt` — added `followUpSuggestions: ImmutableList<String>`.

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — Full Logo & Animation Replacement

### Changed
- Replaced every remaining upstream Kai logo/animation with Brox Kai artwork:
  - **In-app animated logo** (`LogoAnimation.kt`) — the old two purple orbs are now the Brox BK monogram easing apart and reuniting, theme-adaptive (cyan + navy on light, cyan + supporting blue on dark).
  - **Android adaptive icon** — `composeApp` launcher foreground, background and a new `ic_launcher_monochrome.xml` now use the Brox BK monogram (matching `androidApp`).
  - **Android notification icon** (`ic_notification.xml`) — purple rings replaced with a white BK alpha mask.
  - **Web app icon** (`site/img/icon.svg`, `composeApp/.../wasmJsMain/resources/icon.svg`) — Brox navy/cyan app icon.
  - **Favicons** (`site/img/favicon.ico`, wasm `favicon.ico`) — regenerated as multi-size Brox ICOs (16/32/48/64).
  - **Apple touch icon** (`apple-icon-180x180.png`) — regenerated from the Brox 384px export.
  - **Animated hero logo** (`site/img/logo_animation.svg`) — Brox BK symbol with a float + sparkle animation.
  - **Animated logo GIF** (`site/img/logo_animation.gif`) — replaced with the Brox animation (`Brox_Kai_v2_logo_animation.gif`), used by the README; the loose root copy was removed.
- `site/index.html` — hero mascot alt text updated to "Brox Kai animated logo".

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — OpenCode Console Integration

### Added
- Added OpenCode Console default models (20 curated coding models)
  - Free models: Big Pickle, GLM-5.3-Flash Free, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash Free, MiniMax M3.1 Flash Free, Beam Free, LL Alpha Free, Exo Free, MiMo-V2.6-Flash Free, Nemotron 3 Ultra Free, Nemotron 3.5 Lightning Free
  - Paid models: Claude Sonnet 5.5, Claude Opus 5.5, GPT 6.1 Sol, GPT 5.5, GPT 5.3 Codex, Grok 4.7, GLM 5.3, Kimi K2.7 Code, DeepSeek V4 Pro, Qwen3.8 Max
- Default model set to `big-pickle` (free)
- Updated API key URL to point to OpenCode Console dashboard (`opencode.ai/console`)
- API key is now **optional** for OpenCode:
  - **With key** → authenticated access to Console models (free + paid)
  - **Without key** → requests carry no `Authorization` header; the public model catalog still loads, and a rejected chat request (OpenCode answers 403) is reported as an invalid-key error so the built-in **Free** service fallback takes over automatically.
- OpenCode 403 responses now map to "invalid API key" instead of a misleading "content moderation" error.

### Changed
- `Service.kt` — OpenCode service enhanced with curated model list, Console links, and optional API key (`requiresApiKey = false`, `supportsOptionalApiKey = true`)
- `Requests.kt` — OpenCode 403 → invalid-key error mapping

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — P0-B Shell Hardening

### Security
- Replaced blocklist with allowlist (fail-closed) for shell command execution
- Eliminated shell interpretation — commands run directly via ProcessBuilder (no `sh -c`/`cmd /c`)
- Added shell metacharacter rejection (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, backticks, etc.)
- Added path traversal protection (`..` in arguments)
- Added dangerous flag rejection (`-rf`, `-R`, `--force`, etc.)
- Extended blocked environment variables (added JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS, PYTHONSTARTUP, NODE_OPTIONS, etc.)
- Added working directory restriction (must be within project root)
- Added environment variable value validation (reject metacharacters)

### Changed
- `ShellCommandTool.kt` — complete rewrite: allowlist-based, no shell interpretation
- Tool description updated to reflect no pipes/redirections/chaining support

### Limitations
- Pipes (`|`), redirections (`>`), chaining (`&&`) no longer supported
- Allowlist may need expansion for additional use cases

---

## Brox Kai v2.0 — P0-A Security Hardening

### Security
- Restricted Android cleartext HTTP to localhost only (was globally permitted)
- Disabled Android backup (`allowBackup=false`) — prevents ADB/cloud data exfiltration
- Tightened backup/data-extraction rules to exclude conversation DB and encrypted settings
- Added MCP SSRF protection: URL validation (scheme, IP range, credentials, encoding), connection-time re-validation, redirect validation, header sanitization
- Disabled lenient JSON parsing in MCP client
- Added SHA-256 checksum generation and verification for release artifacts
- Documented protection boundaries and limitations in SECURITY.md

### Added
- `McpUrlValidator` — KMP-compatible URL validator (Android, Desktop, iOS, Web)
- `McpUrlValidatorTest` — 28 unit test cases
- `docs/P0-A-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` — detailed implementation plan

### Changed
- `McpClient` — fail-fast URL validation, manual redirect handling (max 3 hops)
- `McpServerManager` — validates URLs before adding/connecting servers
- Platform files — `resolveHostAddresses` expect/actual (JVM: InetAddress, iOS/Web: fail closed)

### Limitations (documented, not guarantees)
- DNS rebinding TOCTOU window exists
- Proxy bypass possible
- No connection-time IP pinning (Ktor limitation)
- Unsigned checksums (integrity only)
