# Agent Activity and Reasoning Data Architecture

**Status:** Product and implementation contract  
**Applies to:** Chat timeline, provider adapters, tool/MCP execution, and streaming UI

## 1. Terminology

Kai may receive several kinds of information during an assistant turn. They must not be conflated:

| Data type | Meaning | User-facing policy |
|---|---|---|
| Agent activity event | Observable operation such as MCP call, shell invocation, approval request, or tool result | May be shown as a concise execution trace |
| Provider reasoning summary | Explicit summary field returned by a provider under its API contract | Optional; display only when supported and approved |
| Private chain-of-thought | Hidden internal model deliberation or raw private reasoning tokens | Do not expose as a step-by-step thought log |
| Final answer | User-facing response content | Render normally |
| Tool arguments/output | Data sent to or returned by a tool | Show only sanitized, bounded, permission-appropriate details |

The UI should describe observable work, not claim to reveal the model's private internal thoughts. The preferred feature name is **Activity**, **Agent Activity**, or **Execution trace**, rather than “Show AI's thoughts”.

## 2. Product goal

Give users confidence about what the agent is doing before and while it responds:

- Which tool or MCP server was invoked?
- Is the operation waiting, running, completed, or failed?
- Did the operation require approval?
- What safe, useful result did it return?
- How long did it take, when reliable timing is available?

A trace is an audit-friendly summary of runtime events. It is not a transcript of hidden reasoning.

## 3. Activity event model

The runtime should expose a typed event stream. A conceptual event shape:

```kotlin
data class AgentActivityEvent(
    val id: String,
    val turnId: String,
    val sequence: Long,
    val kind: ActivityKind,
    val label: String,
    val status: ActivityStatus,
    val startedAt: Long?,
    val durationMs: Long?,
    val toolName: String?,
    val serverName: String?,
    val safeSummary: String?,
    val safeOutputPreview: String?
)
```

This is a design contract, not a claim that the exact class currently exists. Adapt it to the existing runtime/event model before implementation.

Suggested kinds:

- `MODEL_STATUS`: thinking/streaming/waiting state without private content.
- `TOOL_CALL`: native tool, MCP, or sandbox action.
- `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`: user authorization needed.
- `TOOL_RESULT`: success or failure.
- `FALLBACK`: provider/model fallback.
- `NOTICE`: bounded informational event.

Suggested statuses:

- `QUEUED`
- `RUNNING`
- `WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL`
- `SUCCEEDED`
- `FAILED`
- `CANCELLED`

Use stable IDs and monotonically increasing sequence numbers per turn. Streaming updates should update an existing event rather than append duplicate rows.

## 4. Data flow

```

Provider adapters remain responsible for provider-specific request/response formats. Runtime services remain responsible for tool execution and permissions. Composables only render immutable activity state and invoke typed user actions.

## 5. UI behavior

### Collapsed state

Show a compact disclosure above or adjacent to the assistant response:

- “Used Context7 · 1 tool”
- “Ran sandbox command · Completed”
- “Waiting for approval”
- “2 tools · 1 completed · 1 failed”

The summary must be derived from actual events. Never infer that a tool ran from the model's prose.

### Expanded state

Show an ordered timeline with:

- Tool/server name.
- Short sanitized action summary.
- Status and optional duration.
- Approval state.
- Bounded output preview or a link/action to inspect supported details.
- Clear error state and retry guidance where retry is safe.

Do not dump complete environment variables, credentials, file contents, raw request headers, or unrestricted shell output into the chat timeline.

### Streaming behavior

- Create an activity item when the runtime begins the operation.
- Update it on progress/status changes.
- Complete it with a sanitized result.
- Keep the disclosure associated with its assistant turn.
- Preserve stable order during concurrent tool calls.
- Allow users to collapse the panel without cancelling the underlying operation.
- Cancellation must call the runtime's explicit cancellation action, not merely hide the UI.

## 6. Privacy and security

- Treat tool names, arguments, outputs, and provider metadata as untrusted.
- Redact API keys, access tokens, passwords, cookies, authorization headers, and known secret patterns before presentation or persistence.
- Apply allowlisted summaries per tool type; do not assume arbitrary tool output is safe to display.
- Bound output previews by bytes/characters and provide explicit expansion only where policy permits.
- Do not expose hidden chain-of-thought, raw internal deliberation, or private reasoning token streams.
- A provider reasoning summary is not automatically safe: validate its source, format, size, and product eligibility before display.
- Keep user approval separate from the trace; a trace item cannot silently grant permission.
- Ensure logs do not leak data across conversations or users.
- Apply retention policy consistently to persisted activity events.

## 7. Provider reasoning compatibility

Provider-specific reasoning fields are a transport concern, not a UI contract. Some OpenAI-compatible providers use fields such as `reasoning_content`, `reasoning`, or `reasoning_details`; other providers use distinct APIs or do not support reasoning metadata.

Current code has historically used a per-service request mode to decide whether `reasoning_content` is echoed on tool round-trips. The exact provider matrix is volatile and must be revalidated against current vendor documentation and integration tests before changing it.

Rules:

1. Default to omitting unknown reasoning fields from outgoing requests.
2. Echo provider-specific fields only where the provider/model contract requires or documents it.
3. Keep provider DTO handling inside provider/network layers.
4. Do not make UI rendering depend on the outgoing request mode.
5. Preserve backward compatibility when reading older conversation records.
6. Do not assume a provider's raw reasoning payload is a user-facing summary.
7. Do not replay opaque provider signatures or reasoning metadata unless the API explicitly requires it.

### OpenAI Responses API

The Responses API uses typed output items, including a distinct reasoning item/summary where available. Treat these summaries as optional provider metadata. Do not reconstruct or expose hidden reasoning from non-summary payloads. Follow the API's documented item-continuity rules when sending subsequent requests; do not blindly replay incomplete item sequences after context trimming.

## 8. Existing implementation map

The repository has existing reasoning-related handling. Re-check these files on the implementation branch before changing behavior:

| File | Known responsibility |
|---|---|
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../data/Service.kt` | Per-service reasoning request mode |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../ui/chat/ChatUiState.kt` | Message conversion and outgoing reasoning-field gate |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../data/providers/OpenAIMessages.kt` | OpenAI-compatible message construction |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../data/RemoteDataRepository.kt` | Response handling and conversation persistence |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../network/dtos/openaicompatible/OpenAICompatibleChatRequestDto.kt` | Outgoing message DTO |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../network/dtos/openaicompatible/OpenAICompatibleChatResponseDto.kt` | Incoming reasoning metadata normalization |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../network/dtos/openairesponses/OpenAIResponsesResponseDto.kt` | Responses API reasoning output parsing |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../data/Conversation.kt` | Persisted message data |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../ui/chat/composables/BotMessage.kt` | Assistant response presentation |
| `composeApp/src/commonMain/.../ui/chat/ChatScreen.kt` | Turn grouping and timeline coordination |

The map describes previously observed responsibilities; verify exact symbols and current behavior before implementation.

## 9. Migration plan

### Step 1 — Audit

- Inventory current tool-call lifecycle callbacks and streaming state.
- Identify where MCP/native/sandbox events are emitted and where they are lost.
- Audit persisted message schema and migration defaults.
- Verify current reasoning display behavior and provider-specific DTO gates.
- Record secret-redaction coverage.

### Step 2 — Typed activity state

- Reuse an existing runtime event model if available.
- Otherwise introduce a typed event model with stable IDs, turn IDs, sequence numbers, and lifecycle status.
- Keep event collection outside composables.
- Add bounded, sanitized presentation summaries.

### Step 3 — Timeline disclosure

- Add collapsed activity summary and expanded ordered event list.
- Support running, waiting-for-approval, success, failure, and cancellation.
- Keep the response readable when activity is collapsed.
- Add semantics and keyboard/touch support.

### Step 4 — Persistence and compatibility

- Decide whether activity events are persisted or reconstructed from existing tool-call messages.
- If persisted, use optional/defaulted fields and explicit serialization tests.
- Avoid storing sensitive raw tool output.
- Keep old conversations readable.

### Step 5 — Validation

- Test concurrent MCP calls and out-of-order completions.
- Test cancellation, approval, retry, provider fallback, and streaming interruption.
- Test redaction with representative secrets.
- Verify no private reasoning text appears in the activity disclosure.
- Test compact and expanded layouts and screen-reader semantics.

## 10. Acceptance criteria

- The user can identify real tool/MCP/sandbox activity without reading private model deliberation.
- Events are associated with the correct assistant turn and remain correctly ordered.
- Running/completed/failed/approval states are accurate.
- Secrets and unrestricted tool output are not exposed.
- Provider-specific reasoning transport behavior remains isolated and regression-tested.
- Existing conversation persistence and historical messages remain compatible.
- Hiding the disclosure does not cancel runtime work.
- Cancellation and approval actions are explicit runtime operations.
