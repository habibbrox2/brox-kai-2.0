# Brox Kai v2.0 — Project Agent Catalog

These are project-specific subagent definitions. Canonical, Git-trackable copies live in `agents/`; matching local Claude Code copies live in `.claude/agents/` because this checkout's `.gitignore` intentionally ignores `.claude/`.

## Agents and when to use them

| Agent | Use for | Default posture |
|---|---|---|
| `kmp-compatibility-auditor` | Source-set leaks, JVM-only APIs, expect/actual drift | Read-only audit |
| `wasm-build-specialist` | Browser Wasm compiler errors and distribution failures | Diagnose first; edit only when explicitly asked |
| `compose-ui-repair-specialist` | Compose syntax/import/state/focus/API mismatch | Diagnose first; edit only when explicitly asked |
| `security-reviewer` | MCP SSRF, shell execution, Android network policy, storage and release integrity | Read-only review |
| `build-test-verifier` | Gradle task discovery and Android/Desktop/Wasm validation | Verification only; no implementation |
| `resources-localization-specialist` | Compose Resources, missing strings, locale consistency | Diagnose first; edit only when explicitly asked |
| `feature-docs-curator` | Feature specs, knowledge bundles, agent documentation | Documentation-only when authorized |

## Recommended routing
- **Wasm build failure:** `kmp-compatibility-auditor` → `wasm-build-specialist` → `build-test-verifier`.
- **Compose UI error:** `compose-ui-repair-specialist` → `build-test-verifier`.
- **Security-sensitive change:** `security-reviewer` before and after implementation.
- **Missing string/resource:** `resources-localization-specialist` → `build-test-verifier`.
- **Feature behavior change:** inspect feature docs first; use `feature-docs-curator` to review authorized doc updates.

## Shared rules
All agents must follow root `AGENTS.md` and read the relevant project skills under `skills/`. No agent may overwrite unrelated user changes, silently change dependency versions, weaken security, or commit/push/release/deploy without explicit authorization. Read-only diagnosis is the default unless the task clearly authorizes implementation.


# AI Agent Guide Index — Brox Kai v2.0

These guides were written after inspecting the current checkout at `G:\Web\broxkai2.0`. They describe this repository, not a generic Compose template.

## Read in this order
1. [Repository architecture](architecture-guide.md)
2. [Source sets and platform APIs](source-set-guide.md)
3. [Build and test workflow](build-and-test-guide.md)
4. [Compose API repair](compose-api-migration.md)
5. [Resources and localization](resources-and-localization.md)
6. [Security and regression checklist](security-guide.md)

## Skills
Portable reference copies live in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. Matching Claude Code-discoverable copies are in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- `kmp-compatibility-audit`
- `compose-ui-repair`
- `gradle-build-diagnostics`
- `compose-resources`
- `security-regression`
- `cross-platform-validation`

## Repository-specific notes
- Gradle modules: `:composeApp`, `:androidApp`, `:screenshotTests`.
- `composeApp` configures Android, iOS arm64/simulator arm64, JVM desktop and browser Wasm.
- `commonMain` includes Compose, Navigation, Lifecycle, Ktor, Koin, FileKit, Coil, multiplatform settings, kotlinx-datetime, and SQLDelight runtime.
- Shared expect/actual platform contracts are in `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/inspiredandroid/kai/Platform.kt` and platform files.
- The version catalog is the source of truth for plugin/library versions: `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- Root project name and package namespace still contain upstream `Kai`; do not rename them just to match branding.
- `CLAUDE.md` remains authoritative for feature specs and `docs/knowledge/` bundles.
